EEG Reader
===============

This project is **DEPRECATED** and no longer maintained. It has old Android project sctructure and code style. I have plans to create another project similar to this one, but in a modern way. I cannot promise any release date. When such project will be created, I'll link it here.

EEG Reader is a boilerplate project for object-oriented mobile Android applications using NeuroSky Mobile device.
This project is a basis for development of the further, more advanced projects (e.g. EEG Analyzer and EEG Controller).
This application is able to connect to NeuroSky Mobile device via Bluetooth and read: 
* attention level
* meditation level
* blink level
* raw data
* brainwaves: 
  * delta
  * theta
  * low alpha
  * high alpha
  * low beta
  * high beta
  * low gamma
  * mid gamma
